# Homography matrix for image-to-world transformation
# This is a SAMPLE calibration - you need to calibrate for your specific camera!
#
# The homography H transforms image pixels [x_img, y_img] to world coordinates [X_world, Y_world]
# in meters, where (0, 0) is the ego vehicle position.
#
# To calibrate:
# 1. Identify known points in your video (e.g., lane markings at known distances)
# 2. Use OpenCV's findHomography() with:
#    - src_points: image coordinates (pixels)
#    - dst_points: world coordinates (meters)
# 3. Save the resulting 3x3 matrix here
#
# Example calibration (typical dashcam setup):
# - Camera height: ~1.2m
# - Camera pitch: ~5 degrees downward
# - Focal length: ~1200 pixels
# - Image size: 1920x1080
#
# This sample assumes a flat road and typical highway configuration.
# For accurate results, replace with your camera's actual calibration!

H: [-0.002772571, -0.000006592, 2.594653691,
    -0.000021567, -0.000003311, -2.634808887,
     0.000006366, -0.001893601, 1.0]

# Alternative: If you don't have homography, you can estimate it using:
# - Known lane width (typically 3.6m for highways)
# - Known lane marking lengths (3m dashes, 9m gaps)
# - Vehicle distances measured in video
#
# For quick testing without calibration:
# Use simplified inverse perspective: distance ≈ K / (y_pixel - horizon_y)
# where K ≈ 50000 and horizon_y ≈ image_height/2
